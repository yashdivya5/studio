- Accent color: Muted olive (#A2B56C) for interactive elements and highlights. The green ensures legibility of code snippets.
- Clean, modern fonts to ensure readability of both the diagrams and the code view.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different diagram elements and actions.
- Split-screen layout with the diagram and code view side-by-side, ensuring an easy visual association. Fullscreen mode available.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience during diagram generation and customization.
